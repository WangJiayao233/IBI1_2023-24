I think the Practical recently is in moderate difficulty. It gives us some challenges and also gives us some tips or procedures.
I enjoyed the coding time and the time when I have discussion with classmates and professors. I think the Practical10 is very interesting inspite of its hardness. 
I think such an application of Python we learned is very useful and shows the power of itself, so I like it very much and enjoyed more.
I think the most important thing I learned is to integrate the basic thinking of programing and the thinking of dealing with realistic mathematical model. The pseudocode also helps me very much, which can instruct my thinking.
Hope for more interesting realistic math models!
