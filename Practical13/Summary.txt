In summary,
the results are:
    
    about the human and mouse:
        The alignment score = 47
        Percentage of identical amino acids = 92.54%
    about the human and rat:
        The alignment score = 52
        Percentage of identical amino acids = 91.75%
    about the rat and mouse:
        The alignment score = 20
        Percentage of identical amino acids = 96.83%

Because 96.83% > 92.54% > 91.75%, the rat and mouse's sequences are most closely related.

Because 92.54% > 91.75%, the mouse is a better model organism for human based on the data analysed here.
