Practical classes are very useful to me. In the coding study, practicing is very important.
I think I have done everything well that I learned in practical classes. Some of the knowledge is challenging to me such as using Git. But finally I have solved all the questions under the help of my professors and teacher assistants. 

I think I can do more creative thing on the Practical.
