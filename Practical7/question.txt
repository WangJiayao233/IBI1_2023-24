Question: Plot a boxplot of DALYs across countries in 2019.

Answer: Line 29 - Line 38 in dalys.py

Results: 
There are several about 4 outliers over the upper edge. Because the median value is close to the bottom of the box, 
the most DALYs value of countries in 2019 are relatively small and the data is uneven. Because the the bar above the box diagram is very long, 
the standard deviation is a relatively high and the change of data is quicker over the upper quartile.
